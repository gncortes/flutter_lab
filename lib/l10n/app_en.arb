    "fittedBoxExamplesDescription": "The `FittedBox` widget is used to resize its child according to the available dimensions, maintaining the aspect ratio of the content. By default, it uses `BoxFit.contain`, which means the content is resized to fit within the available space without losing proportion. However, other options like `BoxFit.cover` can be configured as needed. The `FittedBox` is especially useful for ensuring that images, texts, or other widgets adapt well to different screen sizes, avoiding being clipped or stretched disproportionately.",
